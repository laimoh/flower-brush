let margin = 70; // distance from center of flower
 let spacing = 50; // space between eahc petal multiplied by the counter

depending on the num of petals you want to add run a loop
      // 2PI multiplied by petal num/ counter divided by total petals = angle
we are drawing a circle at this.x with a margin for the first petal added to (petal spacing * counter)

for (let num = 0; num < this.numOPetals; num++) {
   circle(this.x + (spacing * num) + margin, this.y, 10);
}

for (let num = 0; num < this.numOPetals; num++) {
   let angle = TWO_PI * num / this.numOfPetals;
   let px = 50 * cos(angle); //petal x direction away from center;
   let py = 50 * sin(angle);// petal y direction

   circle(this.x + px, this.y + py, 10);
}
